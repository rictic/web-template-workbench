Closure's Safe\n * HTML Types is one implementation of this technique (\n * https://github.com/google/safe-html-types/blob/master/doc/safehtml-types.md).\n * The TrustedTypes polyfill in API-only mode could also be used as a basis\n * for this technique (https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types).\n *\n * @param node The HTML node (usually either a #text node or an Element) that\n *     is being written to. Note that this is just an exemplar node, the write\n *     may take place against another instance of the same class of node.\n * @param name The name of an attribute or property (for example, 'href').\n * @param type Indicates whether the write that's about to be performed will\n *     be to a property or a node.\n * @return A function that will sanitize this class of writes.\n */\nexport type SanitizerFactory = (\n  node: Node,\n  name: string,\n  type: 'property' | 'attribute'\n) => ValueSanitizer;\n\n/**\n * A function which can sanitize values that will be written to a specific kind\n * of DOM sink.\n *\n * See SanitizerFactory.\n *\n * @param value The value to sanitize.
